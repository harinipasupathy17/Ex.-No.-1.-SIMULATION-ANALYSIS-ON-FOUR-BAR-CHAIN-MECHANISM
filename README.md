# Ex.-No.-1.-SIMULATION-ANALYSIS-ON-FOUR-BAR-CHAIN-MECHANISM
## DATE: 
## AIM:
To determine & simulate the displacement & velocity analysis for the given four bar chain mechanism.In a four bar chain ABCD, AD is fixed and is 120 mm long. The crank AB is 30 mm long and rotates at 100 rpm clockwise, while the link CD = 60mm oscillates about D. BC and AD are of equal lengths. ∟BAD = 600.

## REQUIREMENTS:
- Mech Analyzer software.
- Processor: Minimum 1.5 GHz
- RAM: Minimum 512 MB
- Operating System: Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 or higher.
- Dependencies: Microsoft .Net 2.0 framework
- Mini Drafter.
- Geometry instruments.

## PROCEDURE:
- Draw a horizontal line AD of length 120 mm. 
- At A, Draw a line AB of length 30 mm at an angle of 600 
- With B as centre, BC = AD = 120mm draw an arc 
- With D as centre, CD = 60 mm draw another arc 
- Join BC and DC

This value of VBA is used to decide the scale for the velocity diagram.Let us construct the velocity diagram taking a scale: 
0.3141 m/s = 60 mm (say) 
1. The fixed link AD, appears as a point in the velocity diagram 
2. From a, draw ab = 60mm, perpendicular to AB in configuration diagram and in the direction of velocity (downward direction) 
3. From b, draw vector bc perpendicular to BC
4. From (a,d), draw vector cd perpendicular to CD. This will intersect the previous vector at c.

1. First measure cd from velocity diagram  
2. Now, Calculate VCd using the scale of the diagram 
3. Finally, calculate ωcd from the relation v = rω 
Thus, link CD revolves with ωcd = 4 rad/s (clockwise about D)
